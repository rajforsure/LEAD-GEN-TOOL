# Automated Lead Generation & Smart Outreach Tool

This project uses Python, Selenium, and Twilio to:
- Scrape leads from websites
- Score leads based on keyword matching
- Send automated outreach messages (via Twilio SMS or simulated sending)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

‚úÖ This project uses **dummy Twilio credentials** in `config.py` for demonstration purposes.  
‚úÖ No real Twilio account or phone numbers are included in this repository.  

üëâ If you want to send real SMS messages:
1. Create a free account at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).
2. Add your `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `TWILIO_PHONE` to your own `config.py` file.
3. Do **NOT** upload real credentials to GitHub.
